# suicide-mortality-analysis
This project analyzes 21 years of CDC mortality data to identify which demographic groups are most at risk for suicide, how rates vary across states, and how patterns change over time. The goal is to uncover data-driven insights that can support more targeted public-health strategies and suicide-prevention efforts.
