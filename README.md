🧠 U.S. Suicide Mortality Analysis (1999–2020)

This project analyzes 21 years of CDC mortality data to understand how suicide rates have changed across the United States. Using Python, SQL, and statistical analysis, this study identifies who is most at risk, which states show the fastest growth in suicide rates, and how age, sex, and geography shape long-term trends.
The goal is to uncover data-driven insights that can support public-health decision-making and suicide-prevention strategies.


🔍 Key Insights
🔥 Highest-Risk Age Groups

85+ years → highest crude rate (~52.5)

75–84 years → ~36.8

65–74 years → ~22.8
➡️ Older adults consistently face the highest risk.

🚨 Rising Trends in Young Adults

Ages 15–24 and 25–34 show the steepest upward trend over 21 years.
