🧠 U.S. Suicide Mortality Analysis (1999–2020)

This project analyzes 21 years of CDC mortality data to understand how suicide rates have changed across the United States. Using Python, SQL, and statistical analysis, this study identifies who is most at risk, which states show the fastest growth, and how age, sex, and geography shape long-term suicide trends. The goal is to uncover data-driven insights that can support public-health decision-making and suicide-prevention strategies.

🔍 Key Insights 🔥 Highest-Risk Age Groups

85+ years → highest crude rate (~52.5)

75–84 years → ~36.8

65–74 years → ~22.8

➡️ Older adults consistently face the highest suicide risk.

🚨 Rising Trends in Young Adults

Age groups with the steepest upward trend (1999–2020):

15–24 years

25–34 years

➡️ Indicates worsening mental-health outcomes among younger adults.

🗺️ States With the Fastest Growth (1999–2020)

Based on long-term slope analysis:

Texas

California

Florida

Colorado

Arizona

➡️ These states show the sharpest long-term increases in suicide rates.

👤 Sex-Based Differences

Men have 3–4× higher suicide rates than women

This holds true across every age group and every year

➡️ Gender is one of the strongest predictors in the dataset.

🧪 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

SQL: SQLite (structured querying)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: CDC WONDER – Underlying Cause of Death, 1999–2020

📊 What I Built

Cleaned and standardized a real CDC dataset

Used SQL queries to compare demographic risk

Conducted trend analysis using regression

Built visualizations including:

📉 Suicide trends by sex

🗺️ State-level trend comparisons

📊 Age-group risk rankings

🔥 Heatmap (Age Group × Year)

🧩 Summary & Impact

This analysis shows that:

Older adults face the highest current suicide risk

Young adults are experiencing the fastest rise, signaling increasing mental-health challenges

Men remain significantly more vulnerable

Several states should be prioritized for mental-health funding and intervention

These findings support the development of targeted, data-backed prevention strategies.
